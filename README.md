# 📌 Predicting Body Fat Percentage Using Machine Learning

## 1️⃣ Project Overview
This project utilizes the **Body Fat Prediction dataset** from Kaggle, which contains anthropometric measurements such as weight, height, waist circumference, and body fat percentage.

### 🔹 Business Objective
⚡ **Develop a machine learning model to predict body fat percentage** based on a person's physical measurements.

### 📌 Why is this important?
- **🏋️ Fitness & Health**: Personalized recommendations for diet and exercise.
- **🏥 Medical Diagnosis**: Assessment of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease risks.
- **🏆 Sports Industry**: Optimization of body composition for athletes.
- **💰 Insurance**: Health risk analysis for premium calculation.

From a business perspective, using anthropometric measurements like weight, height, and waist circumference to predict body fat percentage can have several practical and profitable motivations:

### 1. Health and Fitness Industry Applications
   - **Motivation**: The ability to estimate body fat percentage without expensive equipment (like DEXA scans or hydrostatic weighing) makes health assessments more accessible and cost-effective.
   - **Business Use Case**: Fitness companies (e.g., gyms, personal training services, or wearable tech firms like Fitbit or Apple) could integrate this into their offerings. For example, a gym could use a simple app or kiosk where clients input their measurements to get an instant body fat estimate, enhancing customer engagement and retention.
   - **Value Proposition**: Low-cost, scalable health insights encourage users to track progress, purchase subscriptions, or invest in personalized training plans.

### 2. Cost Reduction and Scalability
   - **Motivation**: Traditional body fat measurement methods are time-consuming, expensive, and require trained personnel or specialized tools. Anthropometric predictions bypass these barriers.
   - **Business Use Case**: A startup could develop a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform targeting small clinics, schools, or corporate wellness programs, providing affordable body fat analysis tools based on these measurements.
   - **Value Proposition**: Businesses save money while offering a valuable service, creating a competitive edge over rivals relying on pricier alternatives.

### 3. Personalized Product Offerings
   - **Motivation**: Body fat percentage is a key metric for tailoring nutrition plans, workout regimes, or even apparel sizing.
   - **Business Use Case**: E-commerce platforms (e.g., meal kit services like HelloFresh or fitness apparel brands like Lululemon) could use this data to recommend products suited to a customer’s body composition, increasing sales conversion rates.
   - **Value Proposition**: Enhanced personalization drives customer satisfaction and loyalty, boosting revenue through targeted upselling.

### 4. Public Health and Insurance Insights
   - **Motivation**: Body fat percentage is a better indicator of health risks (e.g., obesity-related diseases) than BMI alone, which can misclassify muscular individuals.
   - **Business Use Case**: Insurance companies or public health organizations could use this predictive model to assess risk profiles at scale, adjusting premiums or designing intervention programs.
   - **Value Proposition**: More accurate risk assessment reduces payouts for insurers or improves outcomes for health initiatives, saving costs long-term.

## 3️⃣ Methodology 
**Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Checked for missing values, reviewed data statistics

**Data Processing**

**Model Development**
- Due to small dataset size, started with simple linear regression model
- 
### 🛠 **Model evaluation metrics**
- **📉 MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – Average absolute error.
- **📉 RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** – Root mean square error.
- **📈 R² (R-squared)** – Measures how well the model explains the variance in the data.

**Feature Selection**

## 4️⃣ Machine Learning Solution 
💡 **Potential algorithms to use**:
- ✔️ **Linear Regression** (for interpretability)
- ✔️ **Random Forest** (for high accuracy)
- ✔️ **XGBoost** (for advanced optimization)
- ✔️ **Neural Networks** (for complex relationships)
